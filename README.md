# Financial Asset Projects Portfolio
 I have created projects in this repository that go over different asset pricing models.

 So far, I have created a:
-  Geometric Brownian Motion Model
-  Black Scholes Option Pricing Model
-  Iron Condor Options Strategy Backtesting Project
-  Exotic Options Pricing Project

These models rely on data collected from the Yahoo Finance API and CBOE data. The idea behind these projects was to apply my knowledge in previous mathematical finance classes and go further into the material. My previous courses only provided a mathematical background for my models, and I wanted to provide some real-world applications of them. For the models, I started with a Jupyter Notebook to get my ideas in order. Then, I created a Streamlit dashboard to allow the model to be easily used so that I could pick various assets. For the projects, these consist of notebooks showcasing course knowledge and may have related papers that use outputs of the code for analysis.
