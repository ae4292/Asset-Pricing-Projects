# Asset Project Portfolio
 In this repository, I have created different projects that go over different asset pricing models.

 So far, I have created a:
-  Geometric Brownian Motion Model
-  Black Scholes Option Pricing Model

These models rely on data collected from the Yahoo Finance API. The idea behind these projects was to apply the knowledge I had learned in previous mathematical finance classes and go further into the material. My previous courses only provided a mathematical background for my models, and I wanted to provide some real world applications of them. For each model, I started with a Jupyter Notebook to get my ideas in order. Then I created a Streamlit dashboard to allow for ease of use of the model so that I could pick a variety of assets.
